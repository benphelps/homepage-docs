Homepage is developed in English, most other supported languages are provided via Google Translate. When a i18n key is not found, the fallback language is English.

## Support Translations

If you'd like to lend a hand in translating Homepage into more languages, or to improve existing translations, the process is very simple.

Everything can be done from a simple to use web interface here: https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/homepage/homepage/

When creating a new language, it can take 5 to 10 minutes before you'll see translatable strings added, but the process _is_ automatic. Once the strings are added, you can then start translating them.
