Bookmarks function much the same as [Services](services.md), in how groups and lists work. They're just much simpler, smaller, and contain no extra features other than being a link out.

The design of homepage expects `abbr` to be 2 letters, but is not otherwise forced.

You can also use an icon for bookmarks similar to the [options for service icons](services.md#icons). If both icon and abbreviation are supplied, the icon takes precedence.

```yaml
- Developer:
      - Github:
            - abbr: GH
              href: https://github.com/

- Social:
      - Reddit:
            - icon: reddit.png
              href: https://reddit.com/

- Entertainment:
      - YouTube:
            - abbr: YT
              href: https://youtube.com/
```
